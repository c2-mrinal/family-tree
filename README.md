# JS Family Tree

## Overview

The Family Tree is a versatile JavaScript library for creating interactive family tree structures in a hierarchical
format. It is designed to be lightweight, easy to use, and compatible with any JavaScript framework. With this library,
you can visualize family relationships and genealogical data in an intuitive and visually appealing way.

## Features

- **Flexible Data Input**: Accepts data in object format, allowing you to define family relationships and hierarchy
  easily.
- **Framework Agnostic**: Works seamlessly with any JavaScript framework, including React, Angular, Vue.js, and more.
- **Customizable Styling**: Provides CSS classes for styling, allowing you to customize the appearance of the family
  tree to suit your needs.
- **Interactive Interface**: Supports interactive features such as collapsible nodes and tooltips for enhanced user
  experience.
- **Dynamic Rendering**: Dynamically renders the family tree structure based on the provided data, enabling real-time
  updates and modifications.

## Installation

```bash
npm install js-family-tree
